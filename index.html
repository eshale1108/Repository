        <p> In these uncertain times, astrology serves as a guiding light, offering hope and insights into both the present and the future. Drawing upon ancient wisdom and intuitive healing practices, I have dedicated myself to this path of study since the age of 15. Recently, I made the decision to deepen my knowledge and skills by enrolling in Rising Woman's Mystic Astrology Apprenticeship program, where I've had the privilege of learning from Andrea's unique astrology system.  </p>
