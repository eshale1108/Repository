<h1>Hi, I'm Evelyn Hale...</h1>
<p>I'm thrilled to share a bit about my journey and the transformative work I offer as an astrologer-in-training through Rising Woman's Mystic Astrologer program.</p>
<p>In these uncertain times, astrology serves as a guiding light, offering hope and insights into both the present moment and the future. Drawing upon ancient wisdom and intuitive healing practices, I have dedicated myself to this path of study since the age of 15. Recently, I made the decision to further deepen my knowledge and skills by enrolling in Rising Woman's Mystic Astrology Apprenticeship program, where I've had the privilege of learning from Andrea's unique astrology system. My journey as a healer began in childhood, where I navigated the complexities of trauma and abuse. Through embodiment and healing, I found my way to releasing hidden programming and reclaiming personal power. Now, I am committed to helping others on their healing journey, particularly survivors of childhood trauma, by guiding them to reconnect with their inner wisdom and break free from limiting beliefs.</p>
<p>If my story resonates with you and you feel inspired to explore astrology as a tool for personal growth and healing, I invite you to book an astrology reading with me. Together, we can uncover the insights and guidance that the stars hold for you on your journey. I look forward to connecting with you and supporting you on your path to greater clarity, healing, and empowerment.</p>
